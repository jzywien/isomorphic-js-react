# isomorphic-js-react

## Getting Started
1. Install npm dependencies -- `npm install`
2. Start webpack and the dev server -- `npm start`
3. Open browser at localhost:8080

## Isomorphic vs. Non-Isomorphic
There are two branches in this repo, `master` and `no-server-side-rendering`. `master` is a full isomorphic implementation,
while `no-server-side-rendering` is just that, your normal react app with no SSR.  You can compare the changes required to make
the application isomorphic by looking at the compare diff here:
